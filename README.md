# Single-Sign-On
Single sign-on (SSO) server-side scripts for service provider and identity provider.

This library provides a secure but easily configurable implementation for SSO. This project is production-ready but not designed for enterprise use.

`login/` for service provider and `sso/` for identity provider.
